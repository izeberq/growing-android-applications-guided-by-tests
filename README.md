This is a sample project based on [Novoda's blog](http://novoda.com/blog/blog/categories/gaagbt).

In this fork I've made it to compile and run tests (with Junit4) against gradle 1.1.0 and Android Studio 1.1.0 (with new testing support). Even though project is old and not finished, it still has some great ideas about architecture and BDD approach on developing Android app.
